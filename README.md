# sorting-algorithms
## Implementations of various comparison-based sorting algorithms, and their run-time analysis:
    Quick Sort
    Merge Sort
    Insertion Sort
    Heap Sort
    Bubble Sort
    Selection Sort
    

I have started this project so that I can better understand how these algorithms work. I'd like to know them all by heart
by the time I've completed the project. For now I will implement them in C++. :) Yay for learning!
